'Childhood' is the age spam ranging from birth to adolescence. It is a kingdom where nobody dies, just as a rose gets its colour and fragrance from its roots, man gets his virtues from his chilhood. According to the International Labour Organization there are tremendous economic benefits if children are sent to school. Without education, children do not gain the necessary skills and understanding.


From early childhood, children are forced to work. Child labour is highly prevalent in the leather, fireworks, silk, diamond industry, brick kilns and as domestic help. Low paid child labourers lower India's per capita income and hazardous working conditions lowers India's welfare level too. Further high illiteracy rate puts long term economic growth at risk. To keep the economy prospering, a vital criteria is to have an educated work force equipped with relevant skills. Additionally the lack of female education can be an impediment to the countries social and economic development.


The problem of child labour continues to pose a challenge before the nation. The government has been taking several pro-active measures to tackle this problem. Considering the magnitude and extent of this problem, we see it inextricably linked to poverty and illiteracy. Thus, it requires a concerted effort from all sections of the society to make a dent in the problem. When you educate a boy, you educate an individual, when you educate a girl you educate a generation. Join hand and bring a smile of freedom, and peace on the face of every child. Save Childhood Save Future.
