A disaster is a hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction, loss of life, or drastic change to the environment. Disasters fall into two major categories. These include man made and natural disasters. Man-made disasters are disasters due to result of of human intent, negligence or involving a failure of a man-made system that leads to human suffering and environmental damage. Man-made disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Fires, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/ radiation are some examples resulting the human hazards. Man has cut forests recklessly to clear the land for cultivation and along with this environmental degradation has taken place, which also affects human life.


Man-made hazards or disasters are sometimes referred to as anthropogenic. Man-made disasters can be divided into different categories. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened, for instance terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event. The rising population has resulted in high fuel consumption and reduction of natural resources. Over population also affects our social environment. Another type of disaster that falls in this category is nuclear bomb. Other types of man made disasters which are just as catastrophic include chemical spill, oil spill, arson and terrorism.
