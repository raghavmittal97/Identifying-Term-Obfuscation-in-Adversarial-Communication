Indian culture is the Mother of all cultures, be it art of living or apparently the rich knowledge of Science and Music. All the regions and religions of the world have their own culture with many customs, traditions and refined qualities. It is a culture of love, respect, honouring others and humbling ones own ego so that the inner nature, which is naturally pure and modest will shine forth.


Respect and reverence for elders is a key stone of Indian culture. This genuine acknowledgment of seniority is demonstrated through endering customs, like, not sitting while they are standing, even serving their food first. We find the youngsters never using the proper names of their elders. In respect, we touch the feet of all elders, holy men and women in recognition of their great humility and attainment. A student touches the feet of his teacher. Purity in mind, body, speech, thought, word and deed is vitally important for us. The concept of 'Zero' and the primordial sound of 'Om' was given by India.


We should never use harsh, angered and indecent language and keep our body healthy and clean. Giving things with the left hand to others is considered a subtle insult. One must not sniff flowers picked for offering to the Deities. It is very important for a cultured Indian to apologize immediately if one touches someone with his shoes or sandals. The same applies inadvertently if you bump into each other. Thus our Culture is unique and irreplaceable and places responsibility of preservation on the current generation. Thus, a Nations culture resides in the hearts and souls of its people.
