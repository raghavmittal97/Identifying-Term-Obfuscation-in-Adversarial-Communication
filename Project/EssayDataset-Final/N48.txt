The future is here, time has changed. With today's world becoming so technological, it is important that students should incorporate technology and communication into their daily lives. Cell phones are great, they enhance learning. But their can also be a distraction if students use them in the wrong way. When it comes to allowance of cell phones what matters is that students should be mature enough to use it justifiably.


Whenever teacher is teaching, he or she can ask the students to search for various answers on the Internet through the cell phones. By this way students will also take interest in studies.


While doing studies, students can also use cell phones for other purposes like for calculations which are complex through calculator. They can also use cell phones as dictionary for searching meanings of different words.


Students can record video or audio of what teacher teaches during his or her class and can watch it or listen to it later in the hour of need. Cell phones can also be useful to students doing adversity and problems. Cell phones will also minimize the educational expenses.


If it is a battle worth to ban or not, to ban the cell phones altogether, I feel that finding positive uses for this might become the key to success in the field of education. All we have to do is to find a balance. Nothing can replace the basics but, in my opinion, with technology ruling the world, gadgets should be allowed to become a part of the educational scenario.
