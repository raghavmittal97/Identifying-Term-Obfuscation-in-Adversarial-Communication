Respect and reverence for elders is a key stone of any culture. In 21st Century, man is living in an age where popular culture has almost extinguished the light of manhood. A growing number of young man have never received a vision of what a gentleman can be, this is the real picture of today.


This new generation of candy slavery can no longer depend on the images that current popular culture has given them. Respect and reverence for elders is demonstrated through endearing customs, like, not sitting while they are standing, even serving their food first. We find the youngsters never using the proper names of their elders too. Today new generation is not touching the feet of all elders, holy men and women in recognition of their great humility and attainment.


There is no end to crimes even after a lot of development but a lot of increase in it. What matters if women are educated in today’s world but the crimes are just upon them at a sight. The youngsters riding motorcycles snatch the jewelleries of women walking on the street etc.


We should never use harsh, angered and indecent language and keep our body healthy and clean. It is very important for a cultured and civilized man to apologize immediately if one touches someone with his nails and feet, but in 21st century these things are not happening. The character traits of courage, vision, discipline, loyalty and work ethic are disappearing from this generation of young man. But most importantly they lack the courage to become risk takers and leaders at home, in their community, and at work.


In the End I would like to say that “The quest for true manhood, authentic leadership, has to be intentional.”
