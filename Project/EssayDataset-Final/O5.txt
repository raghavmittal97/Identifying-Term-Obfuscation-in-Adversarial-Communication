A visit to a historical city is always an exciting experience. It is a fascinating adventure. I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Delhi. New Delhi is the capital of India. It is a city of great historical importance of its own.


With my family, I reached Delhi by train. After some rest, we undertook a lamb to Delhi. Delhi is a historical city. It has been called by different names in different periods of time. On one hand there are Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, India Gate which narrate the glorious past of India; while Rashtrapati Bhawan, Lotus Temple, Parliament, to name a few, are the wonders of modern times.


We visited the Red Fort first. The Red Fort is also known as Lal Quila and is the landmark of Delhi. It stands on the bank of river Yamuna. It was built by Shah Jehan in 1648. It is built using red stones. It consisted of Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas, Rang Mahal etc. Then we visited Raj Ghat, Parliament, diapers India Gate and Lotus Temple.


Next day we visited the Qutub Minar. It is one of the beautiful and perfect towers in the world. It has a blend of pink, red arid orange stone and many artistic carvings. It is a gem of architecture I liked it very much. Then we went to see the Iron Pillar and the Jamma Masjid. The biggest of all circus in India. We visited jantar-mantar an old astrological lab.


By the evening, we had completed the tour of Delhi and returned back. I enjoyed my trip to the Delhi very much. It was really an unforgettable experience which apart from being intellectually rewarding gave us a glimpse of our country's proud history.
