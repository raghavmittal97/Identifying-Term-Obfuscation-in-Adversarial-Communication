A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience. It is a fascinating adventure. I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Amritsar.


With my family, I reached Amritsar by train. After some rest, we undertook a visit to Amritsar. Amritsar is a historical city. We visited the Golden Temple first. The Golden Temple in Amritsar is the holiest shrine of the Sikh region. This Temple has been destroyed many times and had been rebuilt again. It was built during the reign of Akbar, who had great respect for all religions. The domes of the Temple are covered in gold.


Golden Temple of Amristar is also known as Harmandar Sahib or Darbar Sahib. It is a great pilgrimage centre of the Sikhs. The holy temple was completed under the direct control and supervision of Guru Arjan Dev. It's foundation stone was laid by a renowned Muslim divine, Mian Mir. It was given four computers, one in each direction. It has a large pool around it.



By noon, we had completed the tour of Golden Temple and returned back. I enjoyed my trip to the Golden Temple very much. It was really an unforgettable experience which apart from being intellectually rewarding gave us a glimpse of our country's proud history.
