The little boy found it amusing and accepted the task
Every time he lost his temper, he ran to the fence and hammered a nail
His anger drove him to hammer nails on the fence 30 times on the first day!
After the next few days, the number of nails hammered on the fence was reduced to half
The little boy found it very difficult to hammer the nails and decided to control his temper
Gradually, the number of nails hammered to the fence was reduced and the day arrived when no nail was hammered!
The boy did not lose his temper at all that day
For the next several days, he did not lose his temper, and so did not hammer any nail
Now, his father told him to remove the nails each time the boy controlled his anger
Several days passed and the boy was able to pull out most of the nails from the fence
However, there remained a few nails that he could not pull out
The father appreciated him and asked him pointing to a hole,
He told the boy, “The nails were your bad temper and they were hammered on people
Use them to show the love and kindness in your heart!”

The way sand and water work together shapes our landscapes, and our buildings, and makes the best plaything ever invented
For example, here’s how you make a drip tower for a sand castle: You dig a hole low enough on the beach that water pours in as you take sand out
Using both hands, scoop up some of the sand and water slurry, take it to the sand castle, and then let the mixture of sand and water drip slowly through your fingers
When the slurry leaves your hands, it’s a liquid, but as soon as it hits the drier sand of the castle, it’ll become a solid, preserved in the splattery form it made just after landing
Keep it up and you can make a tapered spire of curvy drips
As you add water, the sand will clump together in your hand
Add more water and the lump of sand in your hand begins to jiggle like jelly when you shake it
Add still more and the sand will flow through your fingers again
The reason behind this is that water molecules have a tiny electric charge to them that makes them attracted to many surfaces
When you have two such surfaces close together, water will fill the space between them and hold them there
Two pieces of dry paper will not stick together, but two pieces of wet paper will
In the same way, water fills the tiny gaps between sand grains, holding them all together
However, if you put both pieces of wet paper into a bowl of water, they’ll come apart again
Instead of cementing the two pieces of paper together, the water molecules clump with each other and the papers come apart
So on a sandy beach you have a surface that sometimes acts like a solid — you can walk on it — and sometimes seems more like a liquid
As you walk, you send ripples of pressure though the surrounding sand, causing clams to realize you are there, and to retreat into their burrows with a squirt of their siphons
Geologists have charts of our coastlines showing the directions that sand goes in, pouring out of crumbling bluffs, rolling down rivers, flowing along shorelines, piling into peninsulas or dunes
Just as we can divide the landscape into different watersheds, geologists can map out different areas according to the source of the sediment flowing through them
Creatures who live on sand have to be able to move, to dig themselves in and dig themselves out
Even the most sedentary of sand species — the sand dollar —moves around
It moves its spines in ripples to propel itself across and through the sand
It takes in sand particles to weigh one end down in the sand, tilting the other end up to capture plankton from the water
This is the best part: a churning tableau of destruction
When it’s done, the kids will start building a dam again
There’s the simple sensory pleasure of feeling your toes sink into the soft, warm surface of the beach
The soft, cushioned surface gives people throwing balls or Frisbees the freedom to jump higher and lunge with abandon
Many runners like to train on sand because it strengthens their ankles and calves
Using hands or simple tools, people can make sand into fantastic shapes, decorate it with shells, rocks and seaweed, and channel water to make canals
To get a sense of the scope of sand and water to fascinate, stop by the south end of Seattle’s Golden Gardens Beach on a weekend day when it isn’t raining much
This is where a small creek comes out of a culvert and curves across the sand into Shilshole Bay
There will be kids there, playing with the sand and water
And I mean kids in the broadest sense of the term
You can find preschoolers there, and you can find teenagers, gleefully shoveling away
My eldest is now a six-foot high school sophomore, but he shows no sign of outgrowing this
This usually takes several kids shoveling sand into the stream path, until the water below the dam is a trickle and the stream behind swells into a big pool
As the pool swells, the kids patrol the expanding dam, raising it and repairing weak spots
The bigger the dam, the more frequently the leaks keep coming, until finally a large section liquefies and gives way, releasing an unstoppable surge of water
This is the best part: a churning tableau of destruction
When it’s done, the kids will start building a dam again
On hot, crowded days, there can be more than one project going on at the stream
One group can be building a dam, while another is directing water into a canal system
The kids have to negotiate with one another so that each group has enough water
There’s often a debate among the dam makers between those who rush to repair every leak and those who just want the final destruction to come
They are so busy they barely notice they are getting wet, and their arms, legs, clothes and hair acquire a dusting of sand
I’ve done an awkward dance at the water’s edge many times
Leaving footwear just beyond the waterline, I walk into the water, clutching a towel
In the water, the sand drops off my feet and ankles
I walk out over the wet sand, put my right foot into a shoe, dry my left foot with the towel, then slip my right foot out and dry it
But then I have to cross a beach full of soft, dry sand, and inevitably some will find a damp spot and cling there
So I brush it off, but by now the towel itself is quite damp and sandy, so inevitably there’s a feeling of grit
God has given man sweet, juicy, delicious and fleshy fruits like apples, apricots, bananas, berries, cherries, dates, figs, grapes, oranges, pomegranates, mangoes and scores of other kinds of fruit to eat
I like eating apples, oranges and grapes but my favorite fruit is mango
During the season when mangoes are available I eat at least two mangoes of good size and weight daily
There are many kinds of mangoes but I am fond of Dassehri Langra and Alfanso
When I cut an iced mango into pieces and find luscious fleshy pulp of the golden color my mouth begins to water and I hasten to eat those up sometimes when there are over ripe mangoes and I cut carelessly I spoil my clothes
All of a sudden the juice oozes out of the mango trickles down my hands and falls on my clothes
I feel sorry but do not give up eating mangoes, because they are sweet, delicious and of my choice
They I have a bucket full of mangoes and drop big lumps of ice in the bucket to cool the mangoes
After eating to our fill we drink Kachhi Lassi a preparation of milk water sweetened with sugar because it helps in digesting the fruit juice and pulp very easily
Tiger is a wild animal and popularly known as the national animal of India
It is almost similar to the cat as it belongs to the cat family
It is known as the largest species of the cat family

Sometimes, it comes to the villages from the dense forests in the search of food and eat any animal even people
It makes a solid grip on its preys (such as deer, zebra and other animals) very suddenly through its strong jaws and sharp claws
Generally, it sleeps during day time and hunts during night time because of easiness in grabbing preys
Killing wild animals without the need of food is its nature and hobby which shows its strongness and being powerful in the forest in front of other animals
That’s why, it is known as very cruel and violent wild animal
In India, tigers are commonly found in Sundarbans (Assam, West Bengal, Tripura, Central India, etc)
More big sized tigers are found in the African jungles however Royal Bengal Tigers look most beautiful of all
Tiger killing has been prohibited all through the country from the time when the number of tigers was decreasing very fast
There are six living subspecies of tigers found (such as Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, Malayan tiger, Indo-Chinese tiger, and South-Chinese tiger) and three have been recently extinct (such as Javan tiger, Caspian tiger, and Bali tiger)

It is considered as the cruelest wild animal to which everyone has fear of
It is a very strong animal which can jump to the long distance
It looks very calm however very clever and can suddenly grab its prey from the long distance
This is an animal having the combination of strength, grace, enormous power and agility which is the big reasons of its respect and high esteem
It is estimated that almost half of the total population of tigers are living in India
However, in the last few decades, the population of tiger in India was decreasing to a extent
The Project Tiger was launched by the government of India in 1973 in order to protect the existence of this royal animal in the country
There are almost eight races of the tiger and the Indian race named as Royal Bengal Tiger is found in almost all over the country (except north-western region)
Few years after the launch of Project Tiger, it was seen a marked increase in the tiger population in India
According to the census of 1993, the total number of tiger in the country was almost 3,750
km) have been made under the campaign of Project Tiger throughout the country
Tiger is a national animal which belongs to the cat family
It is known as the largest animal in the cat family
It is found in various colors such as orange, white and blue having black stripes
Each and every tiger has different black stripes on their body
They may be different outside however their underside of abdomen becomes white
Bengal Tigers were originated in Siberia however they migrated to south because of the colder climate
Now, the natural heritage of the Royal Bengal Tiger is India
Bengal Tigers can be 7 to 10 feet long and 350 to 550 lbs weight
They vary in size and weight depending on the subspecies and places they found
Females are considered to be little smaller than the males
Few decades ago, tigers were endangering continuously however because of an Indian campaign “Project Tiger”, the condition of tigers in India is in control
Earlier they were hunted very heavily by the man for the purposes like sports, traditional medical products, etc
‘Project Tiger’ was initiated by the government of India in April 1973 in order to get control over their number
The main threats to the tiger’s life are deforestation means habitat loss and population fragmentation
It has been declared as the national animal of country because of its royal look
It is very famous and strong animal known for its grace, power and agility
It is an Asiatic carnivorous animal zoologically named as Panthera tigris
There are various species and subspecies of the tigers are found all over the world
Tiger is an endangered species of the animal however few are left (according to the world tiger census) all over the world which we have to conserve in any way in order to save their life on the earth
Government of India has run a program named “Project Tiger” in April 1973 in order to maintain the position of continuously decreasing tiger population in India
A country which has the craze for self rule and in which all the communities consider itself as one is called a nation
Economic independence, culture, language and territorial integration are the ties of a nation
There is a feeling of oneness, unity and commonness in it
There has been political disunity, and rise and fall of various empires
But Indian culture and customs has united the Indians and promoted a feeling of oneness and common citizenship
It means a will knit society in which all are loyal to their country
National Integration is very important for the all-round development of the country
Food habits are different, crops are different and there is a difference in faiths and beliefs
Even the Indian customs and conventions are vast and varied
As a result, its soil is different in fertility and nature
There are fanatic people who create communal disturbances in the name of religion
The states have been created on the basis of language formula
In spite of all the diversity of culture India stands united
It is because our constitution was so designed to give equal rights to people every religion, sect, area, sex and culture
We cannot forget the noble service done to this country by Late Sardar Vallahbhai Patel in this direction
He was the iron man of India who wrought miracle by unifying all the numerous essentially needed to keep India alive we cannot allow disintegration of any kind
There are forces now that resort to communalism, provincialism and parochialism
They are tools in the hands of some foreign elements
They do not like to see India united and strong
Pakistan and Bangladesh are the recent creations carved out of India
We have to crush the movements of secession with a strong hand
Let us promote national integration by doing everything what is possible
Let us encourage all the forces of patriotism along with promotion of good-will and mutual trust among people of different areas, castes, religions
Any negative activity in this regard should out grievances of different sections of people is essential before things go out of control
It is a secular country where the people of all religions worship, without any let or hindrance, according to their religious practices, though subject to law and order
The Indian people in different States and regions eat different kinds of food
They have different castes and they observe different religious practices
It is a pity that communal riots take place in different parts of our country off and on
Mostly the innocent, gullible people are incited by political leaders and religious habits to indulge in acts of violence and resort to arson, murder loot mayhem, etc
The result is untold loss to life and property mostly of innocent
An awakening and love for the country should be brought about among the common people
These are the innocent illiterate people who are most gullible and most likely to be led astray
Students should be given patriotic lectures in colleges and the school and college curricula should include lives of great national leaders
Indian is a land of various religious communities like Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and Parses
National integration is possible here only when each community live peacefully together, appreciate other community, love people of other community and respect culture and tradition of others
People from each community should observe their fairs, festivals and other great days peacefully
Each community should help each other and share the celebration of religious festivals
Any religious community should not do anything bad which is banned or prohibited in other religious community
People of different religions speak different languages like Hindi, English, Urdu, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, etc
There should be equality among people of all religions and same facility for students of all castes
National integration in India is an immediate need in the modern time to bring equality among people of all races and equal growth and development of all communities for the ultimate development of the country
Indian government has founded the Council of National Integration in the hope that people living here would co-operate in fulfilling the purpose of its all programmes
National integration is one combining group of all the people living of the nation to make a single identity
National integration is a particular sentiment which binds people together into one common bond of nation without noticing the religion, caste, background or language
We should identify ourselves as people of India not as from particular religion or caste
India is a big country having vast population of various creed and castes
It is a heritage rich country however we cannot say it a country having unity of people
It is possible through the huge awareness of the youths of the country
As a youth, we are the future of our country so we should fully understand our responsibility towards our nation and do all the required activities needed for the national integration
India is a land where contrast people with their unique culture and diverse facets of lifestyle are living
Obviously, it is quite clear that we need to understand the meaning of national integration in our lives and follow everything to give a single identity of our country
People in India belong to different castes, races, religions, communities and cultural groups and lived together for years
Diversity of religions, castes and creeds has enriched the cultural heritage of the India which arisen here a composite culture however it is very clear that India has always lacked political unity
Indian has attained only once a political unity in the history in 1947 when Britishers were forced to go from here
They had followed various types of planned policies to divide and rule here however finally they became unsuccessful
Some of the points like cultural unity, defensive continuity, constitution, art, literature, common economic problems, national flag, national festivals, national anthem and national emblem are promoting the National Integration in India
Instead of being from different religions and cases we should recognize that all are one in order to build a strong and prosperous nation
We need to understand the real meaning of the unity in diversity in India
It never means kind of oneness should be here because of racial and cultural similarity, it means that oneness instead of great differences here
India is counted as the country having second largest population all over the world, where more than one thousand six hundred fifty-two languages are spoken and people from all major religions of the world are living here together
In spite of all differences we should co-exist here with each other peacefully without any political or social conflicts
We should enjoy the unity in this great country where everything is diverse to fulfil the purpose of national integration
National integration is a process to bring unity among people of different religions to create a single identity of India as “Unity of People”
It is one and only way to remove inequality and other social issues like diversities, racial discriminations, etc in the society as well as strengthen the solidarity and unity
India is a multi-caste and multi-lingual country where people from different castes live and speak different languages
They follow their own customs and traditions according to the religion they belong
In India there is not only a diversity among people of religions, castes, creeds, colours and cultures but there is also a diversity of thinking which is a big issue of improper development in India
There is a high degree of disintegration exists among Indian people which make a bad present scenario here with communal and other problems
Because of the disintegration in India, we have faced lots of social problems like partition in India in 1947, destruction of Babri Masjid in 1992, riots between people of Muslim and Hindu religions
Barrier of untouchability, barrier of language, status barrier and other social barriers are pulling us back
Various rules and regulations have been planned and implemented by the government of India to bring artificial unity in diversity however it is only human mind which can bring natural unity in diversity among people
All the social issues arising here is because of the lack of national integration
We all should understand the need and requirement, real meaning and purpose of this national integration
We should live and think equally as well as follow all the rules and regulations by the Indian government for the ultimate development of our country
In India National Integration Day is observed as a most important social event every year on 19th of November
For more awareness among public about the national integration, a whole week programme has also been implemented by the government of India to observe annually as National Integration Week from 19th to 25th November
India is a country famous for its different cultures, traditions, races, religions, castes and creeds but it cannot be unseen that it is still comes under the developing countries because of the diversity in the thinking of people living here
People living here think differently according to their own culture and religion which is a big issue of hindering the individual and country development
India is famous for its unity in diversity but it is not true as people here are not ready to accept others opinion for development
Everyone always try here that his religion is best than others and what he does is always great
