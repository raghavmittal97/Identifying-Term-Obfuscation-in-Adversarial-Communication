The way sand and water work together shapes our landscapes, and our buildings, and makes the best plaything ever invented
For example, here’s how you make a drip tower for a sand castle: You dig a hole low enough on the beach that water pours in as you take sand out
Using both hands, scoop up some of the sand and water slurry, take it to the sand castle, and then let the mixture of sand and water drip slowly through your fingers
When the slurry leaves your hands, it’s a liquid, but as soon as it hits the drier sand of the castle, it’ll become a solid, preserved in the splattery form it made just after landing
Keep it up and you can make a tapered spire of curvy drips
As you add water, the sand will clump together in your hand
Add more water and the lump of sand in your hand begins to jiggle like jelly when you shake it
Add still more and the sand will flow through your fingers again
The reason behind this is that water molecules have a tiny electric charge to them that makes them attracted to many surfaces
When you have two such surfaces close together, water will fill the space between them and hold them there
Two pieces of dry paper will not stick together, but two pieces of wet paper will
In the same way, water fills the tiny gaps between sand grains, holding them all together
However, if you put both pieces of wet paper into a bowl of water, they’ll come apart again
Instead of cementing the two pieces of paper together, the water molecules clump with each other and the papers come apart
So on a sandy beach you have a surface that sometimes acts like a solid — you can walk on it — and sometimes seems more like a liquid
As you walk, you send ripples of pressure though the surrounding sand, causing clams to realize you are there, and to retreat into their burrows with a squirt of their siphons
Geologists have charts of our coastlines showing the directions that sand goes in, pouring out of crumbling bluffs, rolling down rivers, flowing along shorelines, piling into peninsulas or dunes
Just as we can divide the landscape into different watersheds, geologists can map out different areas according to the source of the sediment flowing through them
Creatures who live on sand have to be able to move, to dig themselves in and dig themselves out
Even the most sedentary of sand species — the sand dollar —moves around
It moves its spines in ripples to propel itself across and through the sand
It takes in sand particles to weigh one end down in the sand, tilting the other end up to capture plankton from the water
This is the best part: a churning tableau of destruction
When it’s done, the kids will start building a dam again
There’s the simple sensory pleasure of feeling your toes sink into the soft, warm surface of the beach
The soft, cushioned surface gives people throwing balls or Frisbees the freedom to jump higher and lunge with abandon
Many runners like to train on sand because it strengthens their ankles and calves
